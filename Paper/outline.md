# Summary
Companies and public organizations have been using the Big Data System project to evaluate a large amount of data for the past 2-3 years.
Following the conclusion of data analysis, the Big Data System project maintains each company and public institution's data, as well as other data related to the institutions and big data analysis.
If a big data model does not produce the necessary degree of results from analysis, it is designed to accommodate variances in software development processes, which result in innumerable design and development iterations. 
As a result, based on the growth of big data utilization, the creation of techniques that can serve as a guide to project implementation is required.
A big data model is a method for creating, implementing, and validating a model that uses big data to extract the intended outcomes from large amounts of data.
As a result, I advocate Agile methodology for the installation of big data systems and the study of business models.

The goal of a big data service model is to create a model that generates information about decision data for analysis.
This circumstance is an approach for creating a large data model that accurately reflects the situation.
If the big data model created during the requirement analysis phase is unclear, it will be based on the results of employing diverse data.
Furthermore, data analysis and other outcomes are obtained if additional data is received in addition to the data obtained from the organization itself or the result is a public institution itself.

In this work, we define the data utilized for the analysis data, as well as the data processing based on the data referred to.
A first collection of data, referred to as fusion, is defined by statistical analysis of the data based on each data.
Analyzing raw data, data gathering, and data fusion are all necessary steps in creating a big data model.
