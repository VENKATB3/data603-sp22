# A Comparison of NoSQL Database Management Systems and Models
### Some NoSQL models, for example, object stores, have seen changing degrees of utilization throughout the long term however stay as reasonable options in contrast to the social model in some utilization cases. Others, like protest social information bases and time-series data sets, mix components of social and NoSQL information models to frame a sort of centre ground between the two finishes of the spectrum. The NoSQL classification of information bases is very expansive and keeps on developing right up 'til today. If you're keen on getting more familiar with NoSQL data set administration frameworks and ideas, we urge you to look at our library of NoSQL-related substance

# Why to use Data Lake?
### To begin with, data lakes are open format, allowing users to avoid being locked into a proprietary system such as a data warehouse, which is becoming increasingly crucial in current data architectures.
# Data lake challenges
### Despite its advantages, data lakes have failed to deliver on many of their promises because to a lack of key features such as transaction support, data quality and governance enforcement, and inadequate performance optimizations
# How a lake house solves those challenges
### The answer to the challenges of data lakes is the lake house, which solves the challenges of a data lake by adding a transactional storage layer on top.
